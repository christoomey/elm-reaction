Elm Reaction
============

A game written in [Elm][] as part of [thoughtbot][]'s annual holiday
hackathon. Building it was mostly an excuse to play around with Elm, which is an
absolutely delightful language for building dynamic applications in the browser.

You can hear a bit more about the process of building the app, and some of the
take-aways on [episode 227 of the Bike Shed podcast][].

**[Check out the live version of the app.][]**

To run locally, first install the dependencies with `npm install`, and then
start the app using `npm start`.
