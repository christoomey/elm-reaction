Elm Reaction
============

A game written in [Elm][] as part of [thoughtbot][]'s annual holiday hackathon.
Building it was mostly an excuse to play around with Elm, which is an absolutely
delightful language for building dynamic applications in the browser.

The game was coded by [Chris Toomey][] and [Greg Fisher][], with all artwork
provided by the incomparable [Matt Sumner][]. You can hear a bit more about the
process of building the app, and some of the take-aways on [episode 227 of the
Bike Shed podcast][].

**[Check out the live version of the app.][]**

To run locally, first install the dependencies with `npm install`, and then
start the app using `npm start`.
